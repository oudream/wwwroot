      Commencement of League <br>
      <br>
      </strong> <p>The league will commence on the 15/16 March 2003, and it should 
        be finished one week before Chinese New Year.<br>
        At any time agreed by the majority of the Teams, midweek games will be 
        scheduled, where possible, to prevent a backlog of games developing at 
        the end of the season.<br>
        <br>
        <strong><br>
        </strong> <strong>Cancellation ,Walk-over Rule &amp; Postponement</strong></p>
      <p>All team are given until <font color="#FF0000">Wednesday 11am</font> 
        to confirm if they could play on the immediate week game. Any postponement 
        before that will not result in any penalisation. Each team is given 2 
        chance (R1 &amp; R2) to cancel a game after the date line without affecting 
        their result standing, however, thereafter any game cancel after the date 
        line would be awarded to the respective opponent (a win with 3-0) </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Whenever a team cancels, cause, defer or walk-over 
        a game, that team will be fully responsible for the cost of 1 game plus 
        $50 fine unless the League Chairman was able to substitute another team 
        or game.</font></p>
      <p><strong><br>
        Bad Weather </strong><br>
        <br>
        In case of bad weather the referee can cancel the game at any time, when 
        the pitch becomes unplayable. </p>
      <p> <li>If both Team Managers agree that the pitch has become 
        unsuitable to play, as a result of bad weather, they can decide to stop 
        the game at any time, even if the referee is willing to keep playing. 
        <br>
        <br>
          <li>If one Team Manager wants to stop the game, and the other Team Manager 
        does not agree, the referee would need to check with the League Organiser 
        to make the final decision. <br>
        <br>
        <LI>Any game stopped or played less than 65min (by the Team Managers or the 
        referee), the whole game will be replayed at a later date, unless the 
        League Committee determines otherwise, or both Team Managers determine 
        otherwise. <br>
        <br>
        <LI>If the game is not replayed the score stands as the final result. <br>
        <br>
        <LI>All yellow and red cards received in the original game stand. <br>
        <br>
        <LI>In case of lightning, teams are advised to stop playing immediately. If 
        players remain on the pitch in <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; case of lightning it is their own responsibility. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of replay, the League Chairmanwill try to find 
        a date, time and pitch. <br>
        <br>
        <strong><br>
        Game cancellation due to bad weather </strong><br>
        <br>
        For any game result to stand, it must played at least <font color="#FF0000">65min</font>.Therefore, 
        any game disruption due to bad weather (less than65min) would mean the 
        game have to be replayed. As for the game fees, any game played &amp; 
        stopped b4 half time, half the game fees apply (except JC Stadium pitch 
        full cost apply) .</p> 
        <p>Any game played after half time but ended b4 full time, full fees apply.For 
          any game cancelled b4 play off, teams would have to cover &amp; share 
          the referee&#8217;s cost.<br>
          Any no show from referee would mean SR would claim the game from Chief 
          referee Rais for damage.<br>
