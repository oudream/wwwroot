      <strong>Cup game </strong><br>
      <br>
      Cup games played during the knock out ending in a draw &quot;the best of 
      five&quot; penalties will determine the winner. If the game is still tied, 
      sudden death penalties shall be taken. The players involved in sudden death 
      penalties, will be different from those taking the &quot;best of five&quot;. 
      Teams may provide linesmen for the whole match and not for one half only. 
      If any linesman is engaged, his job is to indicate ball in and out, and 
      subject to the referee&#8217;s agreement for offside, the final decision 
      lay with the Referee. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p><strong>During game </strong><br>
        <br>
        During any game, if a team is unable to field eight players 15 minutes 
        after the allotted kick-off time, the game shall be cancelled and awarded 
        to the opponent on the basis of a 3-0 win as walkover rule apply (unless 
        the opponent waived it) where cancellation cost still apply. After the 
        application of walk-over, the teams can decide if they want to play friendly 
        at the same cost. <br>
        If a team ends up with seven players or less as the result of sending-off 
        or injuries, the game shall be stopped and awarded 3-0 to the opponent. 
        If the actual score at the moment of abandoning the game was a higher 
        goal difference to the opponent, the actual score will stand. If a team 
        decides to abandon the game for whatever reason, without the approval 
        of the other team and / or the referee, it will be viewed as a no-show 
        and a point will be deducted from the abandoning team.</p>
      <p>Three points shall be awarded for a win and one point for a draw; teams 
        losing receive no points. The league shall be awarded to the team with 
        most points on the completion of the season. In the event of a tie, goal 
        difference will decide the winner; in the event of a tie here, the team 
        scoring the most goals wins and if still tied, the then by disciplinary 
        points collected.</p>
      <p>The Sunsport League does not condone swearing at referees. Such incidents 
        are considered <br>
        non-gentlemanly, and the referees are instructed to dismiss players for 
        such acts. This rule extends to players, officials and spectators who 
        are not on the field of play as well. <font color="#FF0000">If the referee's 
        report states that a player continued swearing at the referee after having 
        been sent off (for whatever offence), the suspension will be considerably 
        more than two matches, and will be decided by the League Committee, after 
        consulting the referee and both Team Managers. </font></p>
      <p>If a player receives a card (red or yellow), he can only appeal against 
        it on the day of the match itself by getting a written statement from 
        both Team Managers and the referee in which all three state that the card 
        was an error of the referee.</p>
      <p>This statement should be sent to the Sunsport League Committee with the 
        match report by both Team Managers, after which the committee decides 
        whether the card will stand or not. Letters of appeal written by only 
        one player or Team Manager will not be taken into consideration.<br>

        &amp; agree all terms &amp; conditions.<br>
